I'm a Phd student from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest include embodied intelligence, causality and brain-like intelligence.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yonglu-Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/) of [RHOS Lab](https://mvig-rhos.com/) from School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

You can find my CV here: [Zixuan Chen's CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
